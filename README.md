# Project Overview

This project includes two main components:

1. **Question-Answer Approach:** This component focuses on generating question-answer pairs from text data.
2. **Transformer Model Implementation:** This part involves implementing a Transformer model using the generated question-answer pairs.
3. **Comparison Between Transformer and RAG Pipeline**: A comparative analysis is performed to evaluate the performance of the trained Transformer model versus a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline in answering specific questions.
   

For more detailed information on each component, please explore the following folders:

- **[Text_Processing](./Text_Processing):** Contains scripts and resources related to the question-answer generation process.
- **[Transformer](./Transformer):** Includes the implementation and details of the Transformer model.
- **[Transformer_RAG_comparison](./Transformer_RAG_comparison):** Includes the implementation and details of the comparison between Transformer and RAG.

Each folder has its own README file with in-depth explanations and instructions.
