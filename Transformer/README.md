# Transformer Model for Question-Answer Dataset from Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone

This repository contains code for training and evaluating a Transformer model on a question-answer dataset derived from Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone. The project demonstrates how to preprocess text data, train a Transformer model, and evaluate its performance.

## Overview
The project involves:
* Data Processing: Cleaning question-answer pairs.
* Model Training: Training a Transformer model on the processed data.
* Evaluation: Testing the trained model with sample questions and custom queries.

## Project Structure
	* train_and_eval.py: The main script for training and evaluating the Transformer model.
	* data_tokenized/: Directory to store tokenized data (question/answer)
	* checkpoints/: Directory for saving model checkpoints.



## Dependencies
Make sure you have the following packages installed:
* tensorflow numpy pandas scikit-learn sentencepiece contractions



## Data Processing: question/answer generation
* The dataset used consists of question-answer pairs from Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone. For data processing details, refer to the **[Text_Processing](./Text_Processing)** folder's README 


## Usage
* Training
	-  To train the model, set the `choice` variable to `'train'` in the `train_and_eval.py` script:
		```python
		if __name__ == "__main__":
		    choice = 'train'
		    # (Training code here)
  		```
	- Ensure the path to your question-answer dataset is correctly specified in the path_aq variable. The dataset will be processed and saved as data_tokenized/data_token.pickle.
The training loop will save model weights to final_weights.h5 and periodically save checkpoints to ./checkpoints.

* Evaluation
	-  To evaluate the model, set the `choice` variable to `'eval'` in the `train_and_eval.py` script:
		```python
		if __name__ == "__main__":
		    choice = 'eval'
		    # (Evaluation code here)
  		```
	- The script will load the tokenized data and model weights, run evaluations, and print predictions for sample and custom questions.


## Example Output
- **Input:**  
  The original question or prompt provided to the model.

- **Predicted:**  
  The response generated by the model based on the input.

- **Actual:**  
  The correct or expected response for the given input.

Test Case 3927
* Input      : what is professor mcgonagall concerned about in regards to the behavior of people on the streets
* Predicted  : The text suggests that there is a lot of speculation and noise in the Muggle world, possibly caused by a couple of people from non-magical people known as Muggles. This is evident from the story, which begins to upset due to a lack of concern for the speaker, who is likely a professor or authority figure. There is a dismissive attitude towards the situation, and it is implied that the speaker is frustrated because these people may not be used to this activity and are more focused on it than on the current situation. There have been no longer-clear reasons for it, and there is no mention of a few remaining reasons for it.
* Actual     : the conversation between dumbledore and professor mcgonagall suggests that the wizarding world has been through a difficult time for the past eleven years despite this people are not being cautious and are instead being careless openly discussing rumors in public mcgonagall is frustrated by this behavior while dumbledore takes a gentler approach
-----------------
Test Case Custom
* Input      : describe hagrid
* Predicted  : Hagrid is a character in the Harry Potter series who is known for his love and knowledge of the wizarding world. In this passage, he is speaking to a young boy who is likely a student at Hogwarts and considers his loyalty to Dumbledore. In this passage, Hagrid is shown to be familiar with the wizarding world and its creatures, as he offers to give them a ride to Kingâ€™s Cross Station. The passage also mentions that Hagrid is familiar with Hogwarts, and its size suggests that Hagrid is friendly and welcoming, willing to take risks with new things.
* Actual : Hagrid is the half-giant Keeper of Keys and Grounds at Hogwarts, loyal to Dumbledore, and a friend to Harry.

## Comments
In this project, i have demonstrated that the Transformer model is capable of generating meaningful and coherent responses even with a relatively small dataset. The results indicate that the model effectively understands and responds to the input prompts in a contextually relevant manner.

However, it's important to note that the performance of the model can be significantly enhanced by incorporating additional data. Expanding the dataset to include text from other *Harry Potter* books, as well as supplementary information from external sources, will likely improve the model's accuracy and overall effectiveness.
